# Tools for development

## GitHub
Use GitHub for all code, whether public, private or for a client.

## Trello
We use [Trello](https://trello.com) for all kinds of lists. Some projects are
managed on Trello, but mostly it’s for blog post ideas,
[Friday Kicks](../working-at-pixie-labs/friday-kicks) ideas, and general
housekeeping tasks.

## Pivotal Tracker
[Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/dashboard) is used for projects
requiring a more rigid sprint structure than what can be provided by Trello. It
provides automated analytics around estimates, deadlines, story points, epics
etc.

See 'Sprinting' in our [Tools for teamwork](../working-at-pixie-labs/tools)
guide for more detail on how we use Pivotal Tracker.

## GitHub Actions
We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for continuous
integration. It can also be used for continuous deployment, but usually Heroku
takes care of that. GitHub Actions doesn't charge per seat, only for build time.

## Codecov
[Codecov](https://codecov.io/) automatically reports code coverage on pull
requests. We aim for 85% code coverage (though this depends on the project).
A PR should not cause code coverage to decrease.

## Dependabot
[Dependabot](https://dependabot.com/) automatically creates PRs for updated
library dependencies. Not only is it good practice, but dependency management is
part of our offering to clients that pay for infrastructure support. Dependabot
helps us do this on multiple projects without having to remember to do it.

Dependabot is now an integral part of GitHub.
