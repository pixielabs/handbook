# Estimating

_This section is a lil’ incomplete. We have a lot of internal knowledge about_
_how we estimate and break down projects, and this is a subset of that_
_information._

Estimating is hard. Humans are fundamentally bad at it. Being good at estimating
is one reason why our customers keep coming back to us.

## User story points
- We estimate using powers-of-two, e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
- However when we’re actually building something, we strive to ensure no tickets
  are larger than a four, taking time to work with the product owner to break
  down stories into smaller pieces of functionality. This is especially
  important if the project is running one-week sprints.

## Planning Poker
- We’ve found Planning Poker works well for giving user stories accurate size
  estimates.
- It should be done with as many of the development team as possible, ideally
  all of them, so everyone feels connected to the final estimates.
- It takes a long time, but we’ve found it always pays off.
- When we’re remote, we use [our Planning Poker tool](https://poker.velocitaire.com).

## Velocitaire
- Once we've estimated story points using planning poker, we estimate our team's
  starting velocity.
- We use [Velocitaire](https://www.velocitaire.com/) to do this quickly - it's
  just an estimate!
