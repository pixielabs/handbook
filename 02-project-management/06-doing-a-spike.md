# Tackling a Spike

> A "spike" is a task focused on resolving uncertainties or gaining information,
> rather than creating a shippable product. It's a strategy used when we can't
> confidently estimate a user story without first doing some groundwork.

Here are some reasons why you might need to conduct a spike:

1. User stories that are large and defy breakdown, often due to uncertainty.
2. Implementational uncertainty surrounding a user story.
3. The inability to estimate a user story confidently for some reason.

In these cases, we create a spike ticket in ClickUp. Your spike ticket should
contain:

 - A description of the spike; what does it involve?
 - An owner; who is responsible for conducting the spike?
 - Outcomes, typically 'a set of estimated user stories' or 'a decision about 
   which technology to use'.
 - A time-box; the maximum time we want to spend on the spike to achieve the 
   outcomes, usually measured in hours.
