# Doing a spike

> [A spike is] a task aimed at answering a question or gathering information,

You might need to perform a spike if you have one or more related user stories
that either:

1. are large and cannot be broken down (e.g. due to uncertainty),
2. we don't know how to implement yet, or
3. cannot be estimated with any confidence for some reason.

In these situations, we'll add a spike ticket to the backlog. In Pivotal Tracker
we'll use a Chore card to represent a spike, and label it or add "SPIKE" to the
title.

Your spike ticket should include the following information:

 - A description of the spike; what is involved?
 - An owner; who is doing the spike?
 - Outcomes. Typically, this is 'a set of estimated user stories' but could
   also be something like 'a decision about which technology to use'.
 - A time-box; the maximum amount of time we want to spend on the spike to reach
   the outcomes. Typically this will be measured in hours.
