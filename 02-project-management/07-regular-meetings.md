# Regular meetings

(Also known as 'artifacts')

## Two week sprints

 - Planning & retro: Fortnightly on Mondays for two hours, as early as possible
   for the whole team.
 - Mid-sprint check in: Fortnightly on alternate Monday for 30 minutes, as
   early as possible for the whole team.
 - Standups: daily (except on planning days) for 15 minutes, as early as
   possible for the whole team.

We like standups to be as early as we can make them, that everyone can 
realistically attend, to allow as much uninterrupted time as possible during
the day.

We're experimenting with splitting planning & retro out into two separate
meetings, but haven't decided on anything yet.
