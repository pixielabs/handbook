# Regular meetings

(Also known as 'artifacts')

## Two week sprints

 - Planning & retro: Fortnightly on Mondays for two hours, as early as possible
   for the whole team.
 - Standups: daily (except on planning days) for 15 minutes, as early as
   possible for the whole team.
 - Refinements: Weekly sessions (especially important for large development phases) 
   to ensure we're discussing upcoming tickets with clients and ensuring we're always
   prioritising and preparing the next most valuable pieces of work.

We like standups to be as early as we can make them, that everyone can 
realistically attend, to allow as much uninterrupted time as possible during
the day.

We're experimenting with splitting planning & retro out into two separate
meetings, but haven't decided on anything yet.

## Pixie Daily Check-In

At Pixie Labs, we usually handle a lot of projects at the same time. To make sure everyone
knows what's happening, we kick off every day with a quick meeting.

Here's how it goes:

- Yesterday's successes: What did you do? (Keep it short or skip it if there's nothing special)
- Yesterday's blockers: What tasks weren't you able to complete yesterday and why? Who do you need help from?
- Today's Commitments: What tasks are you planning to complete today? (Be specific!)
- More Work: If you don't have enough work, demand Philip or David for more!

Try to say who you're talking to with each point, it makes things clear. For example:

- "David, I said I'd update the app icon yesterday but I had trouble with my build. Can you help me out today on this?"
- "Josh, I'll start with the Spike this morning. You'll have the estimates before your call with David this afternoon."

Avoid just saying what's on your calendar. It doesn't help people know how they can help you. 

Instead, write a few notes of what you plan to raise before the meeting. This also helps you remember what you said you'd do yesterday.

And remember, if everything went fine with yesterday's tasks, you don't need to say much about it. Keep it short. For example, "Philip, I talked to Michael. He'll launch the app when he's ready."
