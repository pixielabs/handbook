# Working with designers

## Design programs
We donâ€™t like to receive designs in Photoshop. Through experience, we have found
that it is difficult for us to implement designs made in the program. Designs
from [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) are
much faster to implement.

## Mobile first
It is very exciting for clients to see desktop designs, however we always push
to have mobile designs first. We can adapt mobile views to desktop views
quickly. The reverse is rarely true. Intuitively, working with less screen
space is harder than working with more.

## Inconsistent content in designs
Before thinking about designs, we consider what content in the project is
changeable and what is fixed. This should inform the designs. For example, if a
nav bar has a fixed number of links then designing the nav bar is relatively
straightforward. However, if the nav bar has a variable number of links based on
multiple app states, we need to consider how the nav bar will look with the
minimum number of links and the maximum.Is the design still functional at the
limits? Is it still aesthetically pleasing?

Fickle content is highlighted to the designer before they start work, and is
revisited before the designs are accepted. If possible, designs of changeable
components at the upper and lower limits should be made.
