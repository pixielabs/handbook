# Beginning and ending projects

## Kick-off
We start projects with a 'Sprint 0'. We use this sprint to set up the project's
code base and expand the 'surface area' of code. We do this so that when more
developers are assigned to the project in Sprint 1, they can work on different
features without treading on each other's toes.

Sprint 0 should not be included in the project velocity since setting up is a
slow process. Including Sprint 0 makes the team feel as though they're always
playing catch up.

## Kick-out
We finish a project with a sprint long feature freeze, meaning we stop adding
features. We use this time to fix any bugs, optimise inefficient code, tackle
technical debt and ensure the project is ready for user testing.
