# Tools for teamwork

## Sprinting
We use [Trello](https://www.trello.com) and
[Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/).

**We follow this story lifecycle on Pivotal Tracker:**

| State     | Description                                                                                            |
|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unstarted | No one has worked on this yet                                                                          |
| Started   | Someone has taken this and started work on it                                                          |
| Finished  | Work is finished, a PR has been submitted, the tests pass.                                             |
| Delivered | The work has been internally reviewed and is ready for the client to review in staging.                |
| Accepted  | The work has been checked by the product owner and can be merged to master / rolled out to production. |
| Rejected  | Changes required before this can be merged.                                                            |


For some projects it may be necessary to merge PRs to master before they have
been accepted by the product owner (e.g. if the product owner is not regularly
reviewing progress during the sprint).

## Sharing passwords / secrets
Share credentials in the business [1Password vault](https://1password.com/). Do
not use any communication tool. Encourage our clients to do the same.

If clients must share a credential with you via a communication tool, encourage
phone calls, in person, or (as a last resort) WhatsApp.

If a client shares a password with you via email, politely encourage them to
change it.

## Storing files
Use Google Drive for documents (e.g. spreadsheets, word documents,
presentations). Use [Dropbox](https://dropbox.com/) for everything else.

It's really painful managing anything other than documents in Google Drive,
e.g. assets, large files such as videos. It's also painful managing anything
that Google Drive can't open such as Figma or Sketch files. So in these
situations, use Dropbox. Encourage clients to use Dropbox to share these
kinds of files. Set up a shared Dropbox folder for them if necessary.

## Tracking time
Use [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com) to track your time. We track our time
so we know we are balancing our client projects correctly.

## Communicating
We use [Slack](https://slack.com/) for day-to-day communication,
[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for video calls, and [Front](https://frontapp.com/) for
emails. Front is a key part of how we support our clients, as it enables us to
efficiently handle support queries via a shared inbox. See our guide on
[Support processes](../04-ongoing-support/02-support-processes.md).
