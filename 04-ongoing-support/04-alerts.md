# Alerts

Alerts should:

- Be noise free. If an alarm occurs, it means action needs to be taken. 
- Be visible. Alarms should go to Slack.
- Be actionable. If an alarm requires no action, the alarm needs to be fixed.
  If an alarm has an ambiguous action, it needs to be better, or needs a better
  runbook entry.

It doesnâ€™t matter what service you use to achieve this, but we tend to use:

- [AWS Cloudwatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/)
- [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com)
- [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/)
- [Scout](https://scoutapm.com/)
- [Librato](https://www.librato.com/)
- [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) (to collate all the above)
