# Types of support

Support time falls under one of four categories:

1. **Critical support** which covers responding to high impact issues which
   affects all users and where no workaround exists.
2. **Consulting** which covers most phone calls, emails, research and meetings 
   to discuss the project with the client. It also covers non-critical but
   important bug fixes.
3. **Development** which covers smaller pieces of ad-hoc development outside of
   sprints.
4. **Consultancy (pro-bono)** which includes any non-critical internal work done
   under our own steam.

Additionally, there are a couple of categories of support work that we pull
out more specifically than just **Consulting**:

1. **Planning and project management** which specifically covers when we use 
   support time to work with the client on scoping out another piece of work.
2. **Client management** which covers higher-level strategic work typically
   undertaken by the MD.

## Critical support
Some examples of situations that would be classified as critical support are:

- The site is down
- The site is really slow
- No one can log in
- No emails are being sent
- Payments aren’t being processed

## Consulting
Support time is considered consulting if the time spent provides value to the
client. That might be a phone call, or responding to and investigating queries
like:

- My customer can’t redeem a gift code.
- Does this page look wrong to you?
- I can’t use feature x
- One of my customers can’t submit a job form.

Where consulting is more focused on **Planning and project management**, it
should come under that category instead. When consulting is more about
higher-level strategic work, it should come under **Client management** instead.

## Development
This is smaller pieces of ad-hoc development on the project completed outside of
sprints. Usually these are small changes and tweaks to functionality and not bug
fixes.

We work in half-day chunks and aim to schedule the development within two weeks
of confirming the requirements with the client.

## Consulting (pro-bono)
Sometimes we will do some work internally on a client project under our own
initiative. Things like:

- Refactoring code, and
- fixing minor bugs that are not affecting customers currently.

We do this typically because we have some value to be gained from doing it.
Sometimes we have some downtime we want to put to good use. Or maybe one of us
wants to keep our code skills limber in a time of heavy business development or
consulting. Sometimes it’s just a goodwill gesture.
