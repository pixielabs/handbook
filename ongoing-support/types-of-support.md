# Types of support

Support time falls under one of four categories:

1. **Critical support** which covers responding to high impact issues which
  affects all users and where no workaround exists.
2. **Consulting** which covers phone calls, emails, research and meetings to
  discuss the project with the client. It also covers non-critical but important
  bug fixes.
3. **Development** which covers smaller pieces of ad-hoc development outside of
  sprints.
4. **Consultancy (pro-bono)** which includes any non-critical internal work done
  under our own steam.

## Critical support
Some examples of situations that would be classified as critical support are:

- The site is down
- The site is really slow
- No one can log in
- No emails are being sent
- Payments aren’t being processed

## Consulting
Support time is considered consulting if the time spent provides value to the
client. That might be a phone call or meeting to discuss future plans, or
responding to and investigating queries like:

- My customer can’t redeem a gift code.
- Does this page look wrong to you?
- I can’t use feature x
- One of my customers can’t submit a job form.
- How long would it take to build feature y?
- I have a new problem I need solving that I want to discuss.

## Development
This is smaller pieces of ad-hoc development on the project completed outside of
sprints. Usually these are small changes and tweaks to functionality and not bug
fixes.

We work in half-day chunks and aim to schedule the development within two weeks
of confirming the requirements with the client.

## Consulting (pro-bono)
Sometimes we will do some work internally on a client project under our own
initiative. Things like:

- Refactoring code, and
- fixing minor bugs that are not affecting customers currently.

We do this typically because we have some value to be gained from doing it.
Sometimes we have some downtime we want to put to good use. Or maybe one of us
wants to keep our code skills limber in a time of heavy business development or
consulting. Sometimes it’s just a goodwill gesture.
